            I research new computational methods to learn graph representations from heterogeneous multi-omics interactions that aids in the understanding of human diseases. My goal is to develop new models, techniques, and tools that will enable researchers to unleash the untapped potential of these rich, complex datasets. I use machine learning techniques extensively - feel free to check out some of my works!

            When I'm not coding, I'm probably dancing the Lindy Hop, training BJJ, or making home espresso.
